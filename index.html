			<p>This will be a memorial site for our beloved friend and family, Cassie, also known as Amethyst. This will be a space to share stories, memories, photos, feelings, crafting patterns, music, or anything else. You will be able to add photos and words through the site once it’s up.</p>
			<p>The site is currently being developed by their best friend Kerry. If you need to get in touch with her, she can be reached at kerry.z.smart (add gmail to the end of that), or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zilliah" target=blank>on Facebook</a>.</p>
